    "This notebook provides condensed examples of using Harmony to make requests against the HOSS service developed and managed by the Data Services team on the Transformation Train. HOSS can process L3 and L4 data hosted in OPeNDAP, and is offered via two service chains - one for geographically gridded data and another for projection-gridded data. The features of HOSS include:\n",
