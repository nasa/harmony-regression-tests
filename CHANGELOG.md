# CHANGELOG

The harmony-regression-tests repository does not follow semantic
versioning. Rather than a static releases, this repository contains of a number
of regression tests that are each semi-independent.  This CHANGELOG file should be used
to document pull requests to this repository.

## 2025-05-02 [#165](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/165))

### Changed

## 2025-04-15 ([#161](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/161))

### Removed

- NetCDF-to-Zarr regression test suite, due to pending service deprecation.

## 2024-12-20([#126](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/126))

- Update configuration to run `opera-rtc-s1-browse` tests on HyBIG deployments.

## 2024-12-19 ([#125](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/125))

- Update HyBIG test images to account for increased color map range (DAS-2280).

## 2024-12-16 ([#122](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/122))([#123](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/123))

  band input GeoTIFFs.
- Set HyBIG reference images to be tracked by git lfs.
- Update opera-rtc-s1-browse test images to account for changes in HyBIG v2.1.0.

## 2024-11-06 ([#112](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/112))

- Ensure conda packages are installed from conda-forge.

## 2024-10-31 ([#107](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/107))

- Update the net2cog regression test suite to ensure that failures do not
  happen for environments against which the test suite is not configured. Prior
  to this change an undefined variable was causing issues when running the test
  suite against production.

## 2024-10-30 ([#111](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/111))

- Update the swath-projector epsg reference file.

## 2024-10-29 ([#95](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/95))

- Add LAADS DAAC subset-band-name test suite with subsetting EV_250_Aggr500_RefSB
  variable MOD02HKM collection as a starter test.
- Utilize functions from `shared_utils`.

## 2024-10-16 ([#105](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/105))

- Update the HyBIG regression test suite to include a test specifying a variable
  in the request. This will ensure Harmony passes UMM-Var metadata to HyBIG and
  therefore allow HyBIG to use a custom colour map for the generated browse
  imagery.
- The comparisons within the HyBIG regression test suite also now derive their
  CRS and geotransform metadata from the `.aux.xml` file for each browse image.

## 2024-10-11 ([#104](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/104))

- Migrate trajectory-subsetter to use `shared_utils`.
- Separate `shared_utils/utilities.py` into `utilities.py` and `compare.py`
  preventing `xarray` from being a mandatory requirement to use `shared_utils`.
- Update `shared_utils` `README` to mention the github action updates needed
  to use `shared_utils`.
- Remove old `compare_results_to_reference_file` and renames
  `compare_results_to_reference_file_new` -> `compare_results_to_reference_file`.
- Migrate nsidc_icesat2 tests to the new `shared_utils` structure and names.

## 2024-10-11 ([#103](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/103))

- Update the ATL03 and ATL08 reference files in the `nsidc-icesat2` regression
  test notebook to adjust to the DAS-2205 bug fix.
- Update the `shared_utils` function `compare_results_to_reference_file_new`
  to surround comparison assertion with a `try`/`except` so all tests are run
  even when a comparison fails.

## 2024-10-02 ([#99](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/99))

- Add NSIDC ICESat2 Production Regression configuration.
- Update the `shared_utils` function `compare_results_to_reference_file_new`
  to take a new optional argument `identical` which defaults to `True` but if
  set to `False` the Datatree comparison falls back to an `equals` test
  ignoring metadata in its reference file comparisons.


## 2024-09-24 ([#92](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/92))

- Add NSIDC ICESat2 Regression test suite.

- Add `shared_utils` functionality. This directory contains routines that are
  commonly used in regression tests and limits code duplication. To include the
  `shared_utils` directory in your docker container, update the `Makefile` to
  add a shared_utils build arg. E.g. `--build-arg shared_utils=true` and update
  the `.github/workflows/build-all-images.yml` to add a `shared-utils` key of
  "true" (see the nsidc-icesat2-image target in each file).

- Add Git LFS functionality. Large files can be configured to use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
  This PR configures the NSIDC reference files `test/nsidc-icesat2/reference_files/*.h5`.


## 2024-08-30 ([#94](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/94))

- Add regression test for net2cog.

## 2024-08-05 ([#86](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-regression-tests/pull/86))

- Add this file to capture changes to the repository.

- Add pre-commit.ci behavior to the repository. This setup ensures consistent
  code style, catches common errors, and maintains file hygiene across the project.

- Update the base image for all regression tests to `mambaorg/micromamba:1.5.8-jammy`.
